This project was created using React and Redux Toolkit..

## About this game

The hangman game is a word-guessing game in which the player tries to guess a secret word by suggesting letters. It starts with a hidden word on a screen. The player tries to guess letters using the keyboard. For each incorrect guess, a part of a "hangman" figure is drawn on the screen. The game ends when the player successfully guesses the secret word, or when the hangman figure is complete. This version of the game allows the player to take 10 wrong guesses.
